            <h2>About Wall-e</h2>
            <p>WALL-E, short for Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-class, is the last robot left on Earth. He spends
                his days tidying up the planet, one piece of garbage at a time. But during 700 years, WALL-E has
                developed a personality, and he's more than a little lonely. Then he spots EVE (Elissa Knight), a sleek
                and shapely probe sent back to Earth on a scanning mission. Smitten WALL-E embarks on his greatest
                adventure yet when he follows EVE across the galaxy.</p>
